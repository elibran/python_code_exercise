# FastAPI Mini Project â€” "Clinic Slots API"

Build a REST API with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic to manage **practitioners** and **appointment slots**.
Implement CRUD, filtered listing with pagination/sorting, booking flow, global exception handler, and Pydantic settings.

You have **2 hours**. Use `tests/student` to self-check. Instructors will use `tests/instructor`.
