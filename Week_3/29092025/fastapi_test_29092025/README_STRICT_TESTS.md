# Strict Test Suite for Clinic Slots API

These tests are designed to fail unless the student implementation meets the exact requirements.

## How to use
1. Backup your current `tests/` folder.
2. Copy the contents of this zip into your project root so that it **replaces** your `tests/` folder.
3. Create/activate a venv and install requirements.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q tests/student
   python -m pytest -q tests/instructor
   ```
