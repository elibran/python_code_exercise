Announcing: Agentic Document Extraction! 

PDF files represent information visually - via 
layout, charts, graphs, etc. - and are more 
than just text. Unlike traditional OCR and 
most PDF-to-text approaches, which focus 
on extracting the text, an agentic approach 
lets us break a document down into components 
and reason about them, resulting in more 
accurate extraction of the underlying 
meaning for RAG and other applications.
