✅ Option 1: Use the built-in SQLite CLI

Make sure Python is installed.

Open Command Prompt (Win + R → cmd).

Navigate to your project folder:

cd path\to\light_banking_api


Launch the SQLite shell:

sqlite3 banking.db


If sqlite3 is not recognized, download the Windows SQLite tools: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
 (precompiled binaries). Extract and place sqlite3.exe in your PATH or project folder.

Run SQL queries inside the shell:

.tables            -- list all tables
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM bank_accounts;
.quit              -- exit
